Petclinic Angular (forked from Original:spring-petclinic-angular)\n\n\n\nAngular frontend for Spring Petclinic\nWarning: client only. \n  Use REST API from backend WPM_WISE21-22_spring-petclinic-rest project\n  You need start backend server before start frontend application.\nScreenshot\n\nInstallation\n\nUpdate angular-cli to latest version\nas described on angular-cli github readme.md\n\nnpm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli\nnpm cache clean\nnpm install -g @angular/cli@latestClone project from github\ngit clone https://github.com/UserViktor/WPM_WISE21-22_spring-petclinic-angular.gitInstall local project package\nnpm installYou can see current dependencies in package.json file.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.\nDocumentation\nThe documentation of the Spring Petclinic Angular application is generated by the compodoc tool.\nOriginal Documentation URL: https://spring-petclinic.github.io/spring-petclinic-angular/\nAccess the Documentation by calling the index.html locally.\nRegenerate the docs folder with compodoc:\nnpm run compodocDeploy on Web servers\nDeploy on Nginx (for Nginx CentOS installation):\n\nBuild Angular application:\n\n  ng build --prod --base-href=/petclinic/ --deploy-url=/petclinic/\n\nCreate sub-directory /petclinic in default nginx directory /usr/share/nginx/html\n\nCopy /dist  sub-directory from Angular appication to  /usr/share/nginx/html/petclinic\n\nEdit nginx config (nginx.conf file in /etc/nginx/ directory)\n\n\nserver {\n    listen       80 default_server;\n        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;\n        index index.html;\n\n    location /petclinic/ {\n                alias /usr/share/nginx/html/petclinic/dist/;\n                try_files $uri$args $uri$args/ /petclinic/index.html;\n        }\n}\nReload nginx:  nginx -s reload\n\nRun app in browser:  http://server_name/petclinic/\n\n\nDeploy on Apache (for Apache CentOS installation):\n\nBuild Angular application:\n\nng build --prod --base-href=/petclinic/ --deploy-url=/petclinic/\n\nCreate sub-directory /petclinic in default Apache directory /var/www/html\n\nGo into Angular appication /dist sub-directory and copy all files and sub-dirs from it to /var/www/html/petclinic\n\nEdit Apache config (/etc/https/conf/httpd.conf):\n\n\nsudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\nFind the Directory /var/www/html> section and change the AllowOverride directive from None to All:\n /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\n . . .\n  \n . . .\n # \n # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.\n # It can be \"All\", \"None\", or any combination of the keywords:\n # Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit\n #\n AllowOverride All\n . . .\n \n . . .\nSave and exit the file and then restart Apache to apply the change:\n\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\n\nCreate a .htaccess file in the directory /var/www/html/petclinic\n\nsudo vi /var/www/html/petclinic/.htaccess\nAdd the following line to the top of the file to activate the RewriteEngine, which instructs Apache to process any rules that follow:\nRewriteEngine On  \n# If an existing asset or directory is requested go to it as it is\nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]  \nRewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d  \nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\n\n# If the requested resource doesn't exist, use index.html\nRewriteRule ^ index.html  \nReload Apache:\n\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\n\nRun app in browser: http://server_name/petclinic/\n\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nThere are 3 ways of how to start the cypress tests(REST version/backend must be running):\n\nRun ng serve to start the angular application, afterwards run ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open to start Cypress and then execute the end-to-end tests.\nRun ng e2e --headless --no-watch to run the end-to-end tests headless. \nRun ng e2e to run the angular application and automaticly afterwards to start Cypress and then execute the end-to-end tests (Exit via CTRL+C in the terminal).\n\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
